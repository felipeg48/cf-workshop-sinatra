================

Sinatra applications for the Cloud Foundry workshop.

This repository contains two Sinatra applications that work with Cloud Foundry

Basic - an extremely simple app that displays environment variaables. Good for first deploys and "cf push" learning

Advanced - this app contains multiple pages with stylesheets and uses a database backend to maintain data. It has a kill page to stop the application from running and the index page displays various server stats. This is a good app for presenting services, scaling and healing in Cloud Foundry.
